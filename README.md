# Introduction
This is my personal website, and it is also a GitHub App. At first I only wanted to use it as a display platform for my other projects, but gradually I added new functions to it, such as project schedule management and task planning. In July 2020, I changed it to Github App so that other users can also use these functions. In the future, I will build this website as an automation platform and provide more artificial intelligence services.
